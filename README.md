The leetcode folder has solutions to leetcode questions that I either came up with on my own, were influenced by other people's solutions, or are other people's solutions. I just use this repo to keep track of the solutions of the problems I have worked through, even if I didn't come up with them all on my own. Sometimes leetcode loses track of my submissions, but I like to have them around to review periodically.
